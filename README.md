# VulnScan
VulnScan is a Python-based vulnerability scanner that identifies open ports, collects service banners, and cross-references them with a database of known vulnerabilities.

This project demonstrates my skills in:

🐍 Python coding (sockets, data parsing, modular scripting)

🔍 Cybersecurity techniques (port scanning, banner grabbing, vulnerability assessment)

🛠️ Practical security testing (lab setup with VirtualBox, safe scanning practices)

📊 Documentation & reporting (structured output, GitHub portfolio-ready)

🚀 Features

✅ Port Scanning: Detects open ports within a user-specified range

✅ Banner Grabbing: Retrieves service information (e.g., Apache/SSH version)

✅ Vulnerability Database: Compares banners against known issues

✅ Reporting: Saves results in console and file formats (JSON/CSV)

✅ Customizable: Easy to extend with more checks and CVE references
